<h3>
	Why MyQuotable?
</h3>
<p>
	There are a ton of "Quote Sites" online already. But we believe they all are awful. Here is why:
<ul>
	<li>They rarely allow user-generated content
	</li>
	<li>They are covered in advertising
	</li>
	<li>Few sites provide the ability to rate, tag, organize, or share your quotes.
	</li>
	<li>While some have "Quote of the day" widgets, none integrate with ALL of the places you'd want to have quotes delivered:
		<ul>
			<li>RSS
			</li>
			<li>Facebook
			</li>
			<li>LinkedIn
			</li>
			<li>iGoogle
			</li>
			<li>Skype
			</li>
			<li>Yahoo IM
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
Our goal is to be able to deliver your customizable, taggable quote feeds to anywhere that MoodBlast can deliver an update, without advertising clutter.

	Alpha Status
</h3>
<p>
	This service is still in alpha status. It is not officially launched. We will make every effort to preserve your user-generated content before we enter beta, but it is not guaranteed. We'll warn you before we move to Beta, and we will perform a full database backup before we migrate.
